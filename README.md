# yelpScraperTest

This is a test Java program for scraping data from websites such as Yelp. This code is still in the work-in-progress stage and a lot of time was spend self-studying webscraping using Java on NetBeans.

The main goal is to scrape and process data from the reviews of a particular Yelp restaurant. The following are currently work or study in progress:
- coding a Java webscraper program using NetBeans
- studying Yelp Fusion API
- studying Spring Boot (building REST services with Spring)
