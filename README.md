# yelpScraperTest

This is a test Java program for scraping data from websites such as Yelp. This code is still in the work-in-progress stage and a lot of time was spent self-studying webscraping using Java on NetBeans.

The main goal is to scrape and process data from the reviews of a particular Yelp restaurant. The following are currently work or study in progress:
- coding a Java webscraper program using NetBeans
- studying Yelp Fusion API
- studying Spring Boot (building REST services with Spring)

May 23, 2022 Update:
- studied and used Yelp Fusion REST API and successfully retrieved a JSON file for the reviews on our target restaurant: wildflour-caf√©-bakery-makati using Postman
- currently studying how to use Spring Boot and also, how to manipulate the JSON file
- JSON file is added to this repository for reference
- here are some problems encountered:
  - webscraping on Yelp site is considered illegal
  - number of reviews retrieved from Yelp/Postman limited to 3
